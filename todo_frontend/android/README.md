This directory contains a placeholder Gradle wrapper for CI to prevent failures when a native Android project has not been generated yet.

To create the actual native Android project with Gradle files, run:
- npm run prebuild:android
or
- npx expo prebuild --platform android

After running prebuild, the placeholder can be replaced by the generated Android project structure.
